Metabolic cost analysis using Cosmed K5
This repo gives you a code for analyzing the metabolic cost from the excel imported Cosmed K5 data. I have used static standing metabolic cost as a normalizing factor. This code lets you set the limits that make sure you are only taking the data from steady state conditions (i.e. warm up data is not taken into calculations)
